This repository holds all the code and resources for my personal website. The site consists of a set of static webpages that are hosted on S3.

This is the main landing page. It's just my handle and links to my various pages and profiles.

Here I attempted to create a business card in the form of a facebook profile. The page pulls my profile picture and cover photo from facebook, and uses similar formatting to the birthday notifications that appear in facebook newsfeeds.

My friend posted a photo on facebook that had his name in ascii characters, binary, hex, 24bit colors, and crayola color names. I hacked this out as a dynamic recreation of the photo.
