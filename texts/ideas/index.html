		<p>This is a collection of ideas I've had for businesses, products, and other random things. These are not validated business ideas. They're probably not even well thought-out. If you want to build something off of one of these, go ahead. I'd love to hear about it.</p>
		<subheader>Booksite Publishing</subheader>
		<p>Online, high quality, website based books. Emphasis on exceptional design, readability. Well crafted. Pay per book, not ad supported. Release books that look and behave like <a href="http://shapeofdesignbook.com/">Shape of Design</a> and <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a>. Each book either under custom domain or some subdomain. Each book has a landing page which functions like a book jacket. Option to read first N pages for free. Dead simple payment (Stripe?) to access full book.</p>
		<subheader>Window Shopping / Fashion Guide</subheader>
		<p>A website that is essentially <a href="http://imgur.com/a/jWvLA">this</a>. Outfits compiled by staff. Outfits compiled by users. Pictures of the clothes on normal people, not just models (or the floor). Link to retailers to purchase items. Get paid for referrals? Save/favorite things you like, have it suggest new items/outfits based on what you like. Sort of like a personal fashion consultant. But with crowdsourcing and machine learning instead of a person.</p>
